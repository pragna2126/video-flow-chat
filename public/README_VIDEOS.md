# Video Instructions

This chatbot UI features a video background slideshow. To add your own videos:

1. Prepare 6 videos of similar dimensions and aspect ratio
2. Rename them to:
   - video1.mp4
   - video2.mp4
   - video3.mp4
   - video4.mp4
   - video5.mp4
   - video6.mp4
3. Replace the placeholder files in the `/public` folder with your actual video files
4. For optimal performance, consider the following:
   - Compress videos to reduce file size (recommend under 5MB each)
   - Use MP4 format with H.264 codec for best browser compatibility
   - Aim for 720p resolution (or appropriate for your deployment)
   - Keep each video short as they will loop every 3 seconds

The videos will automatically transition with a fade effect every 3 seconds in a continuous loop.
